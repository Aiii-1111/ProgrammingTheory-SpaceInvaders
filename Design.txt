Space Invaders | Design Doc


Game Requirements:

    - top down 2D game
    - Player (a spaceship) shoots down enemy aliens using bullets
    - if an enemy bullet hits the player, 1 life (10 hp) is lost 
    - player has 3 lives (30 hp)
    - game lasts until player loses all lives

    - Enemy spaceships spawn in waves of 10
    - each wave enemy hp increases (by 10)
    - enemy aliens also shoot bullets which player must dodge

    - bullets each do 10 dmg (For enemy and player)

    - Main Menu
        - start button

Extra Features:

    - Powerups
        - Double dmg
        - Double player spd
    - timer to show how long the game last
    - high score display on Main Menu
    - Varied difficulty lvls

Scripts/variables/methods needed:

    - PlayerController (allow the player to along x axis and shoot bullets):
        - float spd
        - float xRange
        - float hp
        - Rigidbody playerRb
        
        - MovePlayer()
        - LaunchBullet()
    
    - EnemyController (make enemies attack the player and die)
        - float hp
        - Rigidbody playerRb

        - LaunchBullet()

    - MoveForward (allow movement for bullets launched by the player & enemies and destroy them when they leave the screen or collide with player/enemy)
        - float spd
        - float yRange

    - GameManager (spawn a new wave when the previous wave is defeated and end the game when the player runs out of hp)
        - int currentWave
        - int playerHp
        - int enemyHp
        - bool isGameActive

        - GenerateSpawnPos()
        - SpawnNewWave()
        - StartGame()
        - GameOver()

    - MainMenu (provide functionality to any buttons on the start screen)
        - GameManager.StartGame()

Implmenting OOP:

    - Inheritance
        - The player and the enemy share many properties (eg hp and bullet launching) - they can inherit from a parent "Spaceship" class
        - 
    
    - Polymorphism
        - The player and enemy will need 

    - Encapsulation
        - Keep methods & variables private where possible, implementing getters and setters where they need to be accessed from other classes

    - Abstraction
        - See section above

Sprites / assets needed:
    - Player
    - Enemy
    - Bullet
    - Background (Space)
